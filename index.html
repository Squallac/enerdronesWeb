    <!--About-->
    <article id="about">
        <section id="problem">
            Widespread adoption of UAVs in different industries has been hampered by various factors, one of the most prevalent ones is the power source and its short endurance.

            Current power sources are mostly Li-ion batteries, and although there have been efforts to “quick charge” them, it still takes too much time compared to alternatives like oil-powered UAVs.
            That limitation is key for UAVs whose autonomy and “work time” directly depends on it, and one that if solved, could open a whole new arrange of capabilities.

        <section id="solution">
            An autonomous charging station equipped with the next techs:

            A laser beaming system to power in-flight UAVs capable enough to maintain or considerably extending its operation range.

            An autonomous battery changer to swiftly remove and place a fully charge battery to automate the process and reduce idle time.
            This solutions can potentially double the flight time while allowing them to perform new tasks with its virtual infinite autonomy.
